        >>>Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application that you can just run. You can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

        Advantages:
        Spring Boot offers the following advantages to its developers âˆ’
        
        Easy to understand and develop spring applications,
        Increases productivity,
        Reduces the development time.

>>>Handling dependency management is a difficult task for big projects. Spring Boot resolves this problem by providing a set of dependencies for developers convenience.
It is a well-suited Spring module for web application development. We can easily create a self-contained HTTP application that uses embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow. We can use the spring-boot-starter-web module to start and run the application quickly.
For example, if you want to use Spring and JPA for database access, it is sufficient if you include spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in your project.
Spring Boot provides the facility to enable admin-related features for the application. It is used to access and manage applications remotely. We can enable it in the Spring Boot application by using spring.application.admin.enabled property.
Note that all Spring Boot starters follow the same naming pattern spring-boot-starter- *, where * indicates that it is a type of the application.
Spring Boot Auto Configuration automatically configures your Spring application based on the JAR dependencies you added in the project. For example, if MySQL database is on your class path, but you have not configured any database connection, then Spring Boot auto configures an in-memory database.

For this purpose, you need to add @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation or @SpringBootApplication annotation to your main class file. Then, your Spring Boot application will be automatically configured.
The main method should be writing the Spring Boot Application class. This class should be annotated with @SpringBootApplication. This is the entry point of the spring boot application to start. You can find the main class file under src/java/main directories with the default package.
Spring Boot provides build tool plugins for Maven and Gradle. The plugins offer a variety of features, including the packaging of executable jars. This section provides more details on both plugins as well as some help should you need to extend an unsupported build system.
