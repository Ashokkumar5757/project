        >>>Java Server Pages (JSP) is a programming tool on the application server side that supports platform-independent and dynamic methods to construct Web-based applications.

        Much as Servlet technology does, the JSP method provides a web application. It can be considered an expansion of Servlet because it offers more features than servlet. Since we can differentiate design and development, the JSP pages are simpler to manage than Servlet. HTML tags and JSP tags are present in Java Server Pages.
        
        To access enterprise servers, Java Server Pages has an approach to the entire community of Java APIs, including the JDBC API. This tutorial will walk you to the path of building your own web application in convenient and simple steps using Java Server Pages.
        JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a Web page development technology that supports dynamic content. This allows programmers to use specific JSP tags to insert Java code into HTML pages. 

A part of JavaServer Pages is a type of Java servlet designed to perform the function of a Java web application user interface. JSPs are written as text files by Web developers that incorporate Html or XHTML script, XML components, and embedded JSP actions and commands.

For many purposes, JSP tags may be used, such as downloading data from the database or recording user interests, accessing modules of JavaBeans, transferring power between sites, exchanging information among queries, etc.

>>>Weâ€™ll cover the handling of cookies in JSP in this section. Cookies are text files saved on the client machine that are stored for various purposes of data tracking. HTTP cookies are transparently supported by JSP, using analogous servlet technologies.

In finding and returning consumers, there are three phases involved:

The server script gives the browser a series of cookies. Name, age, or identity number, for example, etc.
The browser saves this information for potential use on the local desktop.
When the browser makes some request to the web server the next time, it sends some cookies to the server, and the server uses the information to identify the user or for some other purpose.
