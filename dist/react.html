        >>>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.What is ReactJS used for?
        The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for mobile and web application development. Created by Facebook, React contains a collection of reusable JavaScript code snippets used for user interface (UI) building called components. It's important to note that ReactJS is not a JavaScript framework.It's an open-source and component-based framework responsible for creating the application's view layer. ReactJs follows the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, and the view layer is accountable for handling mobile and web apps. React is famous for building single-page applications and mobile apps.Developers can quickly build fast, lightweight, and maintainable user interfaces using ReactJS. You can write less code and concentrate on developing the main functionality rather than thinking about how to implement it. The result: fewer bugs and more time spent creating features than fixing bugs!.React is a front-end JavaScript library. React is capable of making API calls (sending the request to the backend), which deal with the data. React cannot process the database or the data source itself.

>>>React is an open source JavaScript framework, that isn't actually a framework. But it is currently the most commonly used front-end development technology in the world. React, originally developed by and still maintained by Facebook and supported by an active open source community, is in fact a JS 'library'.JS Future. Recent developer surveys show ReactJS still sits amongst the most popular frameworks in use today. With such a vast user base, extensive community support, and the backing of commercial giants such as Facebookâ€”it's safe to say the framework isn't disappearing from the top anytime in the immediate future.React can be considered as a mixture of object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It uses a functional approach to building UI components, but it also has a set of concepts that are more common in object-oriented programming.
