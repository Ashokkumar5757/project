        >>>The Java Servlet, now also known as the Jakarta Servlet, is a Java Server Software component, designed and deployed to enhance the Server services by upgrading their capabilities to respond to any requests through a Web API.
        There are several varieties of interfaces and classes available in the Servlet API. Some of them are as follows:
<br>
------>HTTP Servlet <br>
------>Generic Servlet <br>
------>Servlet Request <br>
------>Servlet Response <br>

The Java Servlet Life cycle includes three stages right from its start to the end until the Garbage Collector clears it. These three stages are described below.
<br>
------>init() <br>
------>service() <br>
------>destroy() <br>
>>>The Java Servlets operate in the form of Requests and Responses. The first phase is the request from the user's end. The HttpRequest object represents the HTTP request to a browser that the user sends to the web application. Thus, anything the browser sends is accessible through the HttpRequest.

Now, we will learn about the various segments of a request received by the Servlet.
<br>
------>HTTP Request Header <br>
------>HTTP Request Parameters <br>
------>HTTP Request InputStream <br>
------>HTTP Request Context <br>
------>HTTP Request Session
